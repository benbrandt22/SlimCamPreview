# SlimCamPreview
A basic video preview of a local webcam, designed to display live webcam video during presentations.

Requires Microsoft .NET 4.5.1 and Microsoft Expression Encoder 4. The project includes a nuget package for Expression Encoder, but it doesn't provide all the necessary DLLs. Expression Encoder can be downloaded/installed from the 'Microsoft Web Platform Installer' here: http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx
